Leo Babauta's Zen Habits: https://zenhabits.net/ (specifically breathe tab and simple layout)

5 4 3 2 1 Technique https://www.bhg.com.au/mindfulness-tool-reduce-anxiety 

Grounding Technique I have used/introduced as Yoga Teacher 
For: all people of all ages (preschool to adults) 
Where: In workplace, yoga studios, juvenile detention centers, sports field, outside, inside, schools (anywhere) 

How it works: 
With feet on the ground, breathe, center, 

then:
Name/Focus on 5 things you can see 
Name/Focus on 4 things you can touch (Optional: eyes closed) 
Name/Focus on 3 things you can hear (Optional: eyes closed) 
Name/Focus on 2 things you can smell (Optional: eyes closed) 
Name/Focus on 1 thing you can taste (Optional: eyes closed) 

This app takes it one step further by having the user write down the results of doing the technique and having the ability to see what others have posted as well
--> Potential user problems to consider: might be too distracting to see/be influenced by other people's results...perhaps home page/breathe page can resolve issue of seeing everyone's posts immediately or as default 

Way of tracking your own thoughts/releasing anxiety while being supported by community

The app also adds another useful practice: Gratitude (taking from the gratitude journal model)
